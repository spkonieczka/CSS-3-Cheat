/* BAckground Shorthand

   bg-image bg-position / bg-size bg-repeat bg-attachment bg-origin bg-clip

	The forward slash separates the values for background-position and background-size. You can include the latter in the shorthand only if both background-position and background-size are present, whereas you can include background-position on its own. So itâ€™s either both or just background-position.

	Regarding the two box values for background-origin and background-clip, if only one value is specified, it is applied to both properties. If both are declared, as in the preceding code snippet, the first value is for background-origin and the second for background-clip.
